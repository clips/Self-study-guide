# Self-study-guide
The aim of this GitHub is to collect useful courses, blogs, articles and videos about programming, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). There are many free resources, like Deeplearning.ai that offer many free (short) courses dedicated to both general AI applications and specializations. YouTube is also a great resource for AI: Channels like 3Blue1brown offer excellent learning material about a variety of AI-related topics. While this GitHub is a great starting point, it is also advised to further explore the mentioned resources.

Good luck, and have fun learning!

## General Resources
### Deeplearning.ai
[Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) is a useful learning platform that offers a wide variety of courses related to machine, deep learning, and specializations in those fields.
They offer [short](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/?courses_date_desc%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bcourse_type%5D%5B0%5D=Short%20Courses) and [long](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/?courses_date_desc%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bcourse_type%5D%5B0%5D=Courses) courses. You can filter by course length and difficulty. The courses themselves consist of videos and notebooks that walk you through the material. Browse through these courses and see which ones could be useful for your thesis!

Deeplearning.ai also offers a newsletter (The Batch) that keeps you up to date with recent DL advancements.

### HuggingFace
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) is an online platform that contains extensive blogs, documentation and useful Python packages for your deeplearning experiments. The HuggingFace [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HuggingFace) channel posts tutorials on how to work with the platform and Python packages.

## Programming
The following courses take you back to the basics of programming and some best practices.
